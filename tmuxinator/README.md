# Tmuxinator
Install tmuxinator and default layout templates to arrange tmux windows/panes automatically

Different OS/platform or server might have different default template to fit the requirements

## Update history

#### 11/28/2022
1. Add README.md 
2. Change Judith (macOS) default template with
  * One new window 'HMD' with 2 even-vertical splited panes for works
  * Execute 'projinfo' automatically when when launching window 'HMD'
3. Rename window 'working' to 'MyOwn'

## TODO

#### 11/28/2022
When excuting 'task' in pane 'HMD', the output presentation would either:

1. Each column is shrunk which results in long list, or 
2. CLI prompt shows tripple times 

Either way is not good, but no idea how to fix them yet. At this moment live with #2 first
